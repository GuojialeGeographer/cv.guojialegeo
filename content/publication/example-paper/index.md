abstract: This study investigates the spatial patterns of urban development using integrated GIS and remote sensing techniques. We analyze multi-temporal satellite imagery to detect changes in urban land use and apply spatial statistics to identify development patterns. The results reveal significant correlations between urban growth and various socio-economic factors.

## Introduction
Urban development patterns have significant implications for city planning and sustainability. This study combines GIS and remote sensing techniques to analyze these patterns in detail.

## Methods
We utilized Landsat imagery from 2010-2023 and applied supervised classification techniques to detect land use changes. Spatial statistics were used to identify development patterns and their relationships with socio-economic factors.

## Results
The analysis revealed several key patterns in urban development:
- Rapid expansion along transportation corridors
- Clustering of commercial development in specific zones
- Correlation between population density and land use change

## Discussion
Our findings have important implications for urban planning and policy making, suggesting the need for more controlled development patterns and better integration of transportation networks.
